# HayStack-First-Client-UX-Project-Group

October8 is the startup from the North of Sweden and they want to launch a dating app called HayStack. Our job was to gamify all the personality questions for the uocoming app so that the users feel engaged and are interested in answering the question. We were 7 group members and our journey consisted of 3 weeks.
